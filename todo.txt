- general idea is to make a cross-platform, well documented, beautiful
looking music streamer in java that cuts through all the dead projects and outdated
sketchy music streamer.
- I want to show how beautiful a java music player can be
however im concerned about performance and readability.
- In a sense this should be the fullest "bare-bones" project.

        Here is a list of features or general things that need to be added.

    [] Basic gui window
    [] Draft of UI layout with buttons
    [] play sounds from different file formats ( *.mp3-4, .wav, etc.)
    [] create,delete playlists
    [] add, delete songs from the playlist
    [] create playlist from selected section from playlist.
    [] create playlist with similar genres from other playlist
    [] cool animations for gui widgets
    [] colorful and flashy animations when playing a song ( cause why not)
    [] database of music from third party?
    [] download music locally from third party database
    [] Buttons to skip song, go to last song, and play/pause
    [] make the project both a webpage and a desktop app
    []
